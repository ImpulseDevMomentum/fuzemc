This bot comes from the Minecraft server named fuzemc.net. The server was maintained by me, Impulse, along with my three friends and Toxly. However, Toxly removed me and my friends from the project and kept all the files for himself without returning any money. That's why I want to make the bot public.

I will **not** maintain this repository.
